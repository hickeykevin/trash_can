    This is an example of a data processor step that prepares the data so that
    it is suitable for model inference. It takes in a dataset as an input step
    artifact and performs any necessary preprocessing steps based on pretrained
    preprocessing pipeline.

        dataset_inf: The inference dataset.
        preprocess_pipeline: Pretrained `Pipeline` to process dataset.
        target: Name of target columns in dataset.
