    """Predictions step.

    This is an example of a predictions step that takes the data in and returns
    predicted values.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured to use different input data.
    See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        dataset_inf: The inference dataset.

    Returns:
        The predictions as pandas series
