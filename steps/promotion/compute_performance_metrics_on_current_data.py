    """Get metrics for comparison during promotion on fresh dataset.

    This is an example of a metrics calculation step. It computes metric 
    on recent test dataset.

    This step is parameterized, which allows you to configure the step
    independently of the step code, before running it in a pipeline.
    In this example, the step can be configured to use different input data
    and target environment stage for promotion.
    See the documentation for more information:

        https://docs.zenml.io/how-to/build-pipelines/use-pipeline-step-parameters

    Args:
        dataset_tst: The test dataset.

    Returns:
        Latest version and current version metric values on a test set.
